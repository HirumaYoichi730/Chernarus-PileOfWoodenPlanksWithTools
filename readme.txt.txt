DayZ Chernarus - Pile Of Wooden Planks With Tools.
I had this idea for a few places with planks and tools.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 4x Land_Misc_TrailRoof_Small.
2: 16x PileOfWoodenPlanks.
3: 96x HandSaw.
4: 12x FirefighterAxe.


So, there are four locations for them. Locations are Zeleno at 2667/4711, Black Forest at 9195/8073, Vyshnaya Dubrovka at 9697/10479 and Tulga at 12387/4371
How to find them: 
Zeleno: From the firefighter house look for the barn on the hill right next to the woods. Follow the road towards the barn and when the road
goes both to the left and to the right, turn left and you can´t miss it.
Black Forest: It´s just 10-20 meters away from the truck spawn and a caravan that is parked there.
Vyshnaya Dubrovka: If you are at Dubrovka and you want to go to Devil´s Castle, you take the road by going through Vyshnaya Dubrovka. You will be able to see a red
bricked pubhouse on the left side. Just keep going forward. And don´t take the right turn towards rBo3AHO(Gvozdno), instead just keep going straight ahead. 
You will be able to see it when you get closer.
Tulga: If you are going to Tulga and you are coming from either of the Castle Rog or from the small village called MCTA(Msta) you will come to a bigger trailroof that
will be on the right side of the road. Just turn right and you will be able to see it. And if you are coming from Solnich, just follow the road to Tulga and before the last curve
just go up the hill and go towards Castle Rog. You can´t miss it if you follow the road after the hill. Easy way for Solnich is just to follow the powerlines till they make a sharp left turn.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/PileOfWoodenPlanksWithTools.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/PileOfWoodenPlanksWithTools.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
